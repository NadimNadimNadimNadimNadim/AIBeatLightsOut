# AIBeatLightsOut
Implementation of A* search to solve my friend's [lights out puzzle](https://mk-lights-out.herokuapp.com/).  
In Program.cs, you must enter the starting filled in points. Uses x-y coordinate system with 0,0 at top left corner (+y is down).  
Could be improved with better heuristics. 
Another local search would probably be more performant, since the production system for this puzzle is always 25 moves.
